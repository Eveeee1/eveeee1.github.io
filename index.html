<h1>Why it should be mandatory to own guinea pigs</h1>
<p>I thoroughly believe that every household would benefit from owning a guinea pig. There are many plus sides to this movement, such as elevation of happieness and decrease of stress, both which would have a chain reaction leading to smarter decisions in many fields of work. However, I think this is just the first step. Soon, guinea pigs should be able to take over jobs of high power, starting in the lower ranks but eventually reaching mayors, governers, and presidents. The world would be an entirely different and improved place. In other words, I would be in favor of a guinea pig apocalypse.
